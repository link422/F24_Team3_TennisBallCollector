# Introduction 

  Tennis is a time-honored game that can be dated back to the 11th century, played by all ages all around the world. When you think of tennis you think of the intense competition, the player’s personalities, and the feeling of your favorite team winning. What is not talked about however is the cleanup process, after an intense match there is a lot of preparation that goes into getting the next match ready. When consulting the customer, they explained that their current tennis ball collecting method was outdated and broken. The current model is operated by manually pushing the machine, this sometimes caused balls to jam inside the machine from not pushing hard enough. The main objective of this Capstone Design is to make improvements to the current Tennis Ball Collector by adding remote control capability and an accurate ball counter to help make the cleanup process more effective.

# Comparative Analysis of Potential Solutions 

The current device used by the Tennessee Tech Tennis team is the Playmate Ball Mower. The machine has an enlarged rolling pin attached to the wheels inside a metal casing that when moved, takes the balls from the ground around to the top into a collection basket. So, in order for the machine to operate as intended, it must be in motion at a speed high enough to transport the balls through the casing into the basket. When consulting the customer on the operation of said machine, some issues pointed out were the mobility, jamming of the device, keeping count of the balls used, and funding. The team addressed the problems as follows: 

|Mobility Solutions|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|----|
|Manual|Low cost, simple implementation |Leaves customer with no change to current issue |
|Autonomous|Self-operated, efficient  |Complexity (sensory issues, implementation of AI, time constraints), cost |
|Remote Controlled|Increased mobility, reasonable pricing, achievable in time constraint |User operated, range may pose an issue, remote must be powered |


|Jamming Solutions|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|----|
|Vacuum|Quick collection, efficiently stops jamming |Installing on current device, power |
|Vibration Device|Provides movement to stop jamming, simple implementation, low power |Vibration strength |


|Count Solutions|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|----|
|Counter|Keeps accurate count, simple implementation, low cost |Seven segment has exposed design |


|Funding Solutions|Pros|Cons|
|----|----|----|
|Tennibot |Fully autonomous, efficient |Costly, impractical |
|New Playmate |Cost effective |Same device will eventually have same issue,  |
|Team 3 additions |Increased mobility, counting mechanism, anti-jamming, cheaper than Tennibot |More expensive than a new playmate, takes time to develop |


# High-Level Solution 

 

What we plan to implement: 

 - Shall use an Arduino Base as the main system of controll for hardware and software system.
   
 - Vibration motors shall be installed into the collector section of the Tennis Ball collector to help with jamming of Tennis Balls.
   
 - Scanner to capture data from tennis ball intake.
 
 - Seven Segment display shall be used to show collected data from the scanner.

 - Power system used for hardware connections

 - Hardware protection shall be used to cover exposed pieces

 - Bluetooth Connection shall be used for the control of the motors

 - Servo motors to help navigate the tennis ball collector

# Resources 
 

  The project requires hardware and software resources to create and efficient, portable, and cost-effective remote-controlled tennis ball collector. Key hardware includes the RC transmitter, receiver, Arduino UNO R4, battery, LCD, vibration motor, servos, wheels, and sensors such as the photoelectric sensor for ball detection. Additionally, lab equipment like oscilloscopes and computers for interfacing with the processor will be necessary for testing. The components for prototyping are relatively inexpensive, and the total estimated cost for prototyping is $1,000.  

  The software resources include CAD software for designing the final version of the collector. Additionally, developmental environments for programming Arduino and any RF control system testing will be essential. The software resources will be used to design, simulate, and test the functionality of the tennis ball collector.
