# Introduction 

  Tennis is a time-honored game that can be dated back to the 11th century, played by all ages all around the world. When you think of tennis you think of the intense competition, the player’s personalities, and the feeling of your favorite team winning. What is not talked about however is the cleanup process, after an intense match there is a lot of preparation that goes into getting the next match ready. When consulting the customer, they explained that their current tennis ball collecting method was outdated and broken. The current model is operated by manually pushing the machine, this sometimes caused balls to jam inside the machine from not pushing hard enough. The main objective of this Capstone Design is to make improvements to the current Tennis Ball Collector by adding remote control capability and an accurate ball counter to help make the cleanup process more effective.

# Comparative Analysis of Potential Solutions 

The current device used by the Tennessee Tech Tennis team is the Playmate Ball Mower. The machine has an enlarged rolling pin attached to the wheels inside a metal casing that when moved, takes the balls from the ground around to the top into a collection basket. So, in order for the machine to operate as intended, it must be in motion at a speed high enough to transport the balls through the casing into the basket.

When Team 3 began developing solutions for the tennis ball collector, they first had to address the problems at hand. Said issues were mobility, jamming, data, and funding. The thought process of the Team is as follows: 

  To fix the customer’s issue with the machine’s mobility there were a few solutions proposed. They were to leave the machine manual, make it autonomous, or make it remote controlled. If the machine were to be left manual, the problem would still be present since players would have to push around the machine at the end of the practice. This would be of no benefit to the customer since they would be in the same situation they were in before this project with a time-consuming task at the end of the day. As far as autonomy goes, this solution would be very effective for the team, however, the process of converting the machine into an autonomous one would be a great challenge. In a discussion with an advisor the team was informed of the difficulty of creating an autonomous device because of the complexity it would hold. In result of these deliberations, the team decided to make the machine remote control operated. This option allows the team to be faced with a challenge in the design process while being able to accomplish the customer's need for easier mobility. 

  For the machine jamming issue, two solutions were considered. The first was adding a vacuum mechanism to collect the tennis balls. This in theory sounds like a viable solution, however the implementation of said solution is where issues would be faced. Where will the tube run to? Where will a motor attach? How will the vacuum be powered on and off? All of these questions were considered when discussing how to fix the jamming, and the decision was made to not implement a vacuum. Instead, the proposition of a vibration mechanic was selected. Vibrating the device at the collector will provide enough movement to get tennis balls that are stuck where they are intended while not requiring multiple additions. This solution can be implemented with a simple vibrating motor that will be isolated in one area and won’t require a lot of power in comparison to a vacuum motor.  

  “Have all the balls been collected for the day?” is a question that shouldn’t have to be asked. If the customer uses a select amount of tennis balls at practice, they should have a mechanic to keep count of how many they have collected so far. The proposed solution to this was to implement a counter device in the form of a seven-segment display that works in tandem with sensor. This solution proved to be viable since the addition of a photoelectric sensor and seven segments both provide a challenge to the team while being budget friendly. 

  Finally, the most crucial aspect of the whole project is the funding. New collection devices are already out on the market, but unfortunately for the customer the funding for said devices isn’t there. A device called the Tennibot, that is a fully automated collector that functions similar to a Roomba but for a tennis court, is available but is marketed at a hefty price of $2,995. This is well out of the customer's budget, making it an unrealistic solution. On the cheaper side of the market is the purchase of a new Playmate collector, listed at $595. Although this is immensely cheaper than the Tennibot, the customer still does not want to purchase a new machine. So, to face the issue of funding for the project, Team 3 chose to adjust the customer’s current device to fit their needs with a practical budget in mind.

# High-Level Solution 

 

What we plan to implement: 

 - Shall use a Raspberry Pi as the main system of controll for hardware and software system.

# Resources 
 

  The project requires hardware and software resources to create and efficient, portable, and cost-effective remote-controlled tennis ball collector. Key hardware includes the RC transmitter, receiver, Raspberry Pi 4B, battery, LCD, vibration motor, DC motors, wheels, and sensors such as the photoelectric sensor for ball detection. Additionally, lab equipment like oscilloscopes and computers for interfacing with the processor will be necessary for testing.
