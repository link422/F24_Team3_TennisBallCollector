# Detailed Design
## Function of the Subsystem

The RC subsystem's primary role within the overall system is to allow the user to control the DC motors wirelessly. Being able to wirelessly communicate with the Raspberry Pi CITE THIS will give the subsystem the ability to wirlessly control the DC motors which will allow for varying speeds, turns, and an emergency stop feature. Being able to reliably control the system from a distance is important for the system as the motors could be unpredictable if there is not a strong signal controlling it. Having an emergency stop will also increase the safety of the device should anything happen. The controller will use a 2.4 GHz USB nano reciever CITE THIS to ensure a strong connection as well as provide an intuitive controller that can have its buttons programmed to do the desired task.


## Specifications and Constraints

   - The RC subsystem shall operate on a 2.4 GHz frequency to ensure reliable communication between the controller and the Raspberry Pi.
     - Rationale: The 2.4 GHz frequency is commonly used for remote control systems because it has a good balance of range and reliability.

   - The RC subsystem shall maintain reliable communication within a range of up to 30 feet.
     - Rationale: This range lets the customer operate the device without having to move around to stay within range while picking up tennis balls.

   - The RC subsystem shall include an emergency stop to imediiately turn the system off.
     - Rationale: This will ensure device safety in case of unexpected behavior.

   - The RC subsystem shall be made cost effectively using only a F710 Wireless Gamepad that comes with a 2.4 GHz reciver.
     - Rationale: This will help ensure the device is within budget and can be easily purchased.
    
   - The RC subsystem shall comply with IEEE 802.15.4 standards for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) CITE THIS.
     - Rationale: IEEE 802.15.4 lays the framework for lower network layers such as 2.4 GHz as its within the range 2400â€“2483.5 MHz.
     
## Overview of Proposed Solution

The proposed solution for the RC subsystem is to provide wireless control of the Tennis Ball Collector using a controller with a 2.4GHz receiver connected to a Raspberry Pi. This will allow the customer to control the system easily. The subsystem will provide variable speed control, directional movement, and an emergency stop function. The subsystem will interact with the DC motors for moving as well as the power subsystem, vibration subsystem, counting subsystem, and display subsystem for the emergency stop function. The subsystem will follow IEEE 802.15.4 standards in using a 2.4 GHz reciver which will ensure reliable and mid ranged wireless communication protocols are used. The choice of controller and reciver were made such that the subsystem is reliable as well as cost effective to ensure that the overall cost of the system stays as low as possible for ease of access to consumers.


## Interface with Other Subsystems

Within and around the RC subsystem there are many inputs and outputs. The controller itself has many inputs with their names and types being: A - button, B - button, X - button, Y - button, back - button, start - button, mode - button, vibration - button, RB- bumper/button, LB - bumper/button, D-pad (has 4 buttons left, right, up, and down) - buttons, left and right joystick - analog sticks, left and right trigger - analog triggers. It outputs the signals from these inputs to the 2.4 GHz nano USB reciver which takes those outputs as inputs and sends them to the raspberry Pi for processing. Once the raspberry Pi has the inputs and the code processes the data that information is than output to the DC and vibration motors. The data being output to the motors will be simple signals with pulse width modulation to allow varying speeds in the motor. The raspberry Pi's outputs will not directly connect to the motors but rather connect to transistor that will allow the DC motor to turn on when the output from the raspberry Pi is high.
