## Meeting Notes:
We chose to meet earlier during the week due to us not having school during the latter part of the week. Since our last meeting we were able to complete and turn in the experimental analysis, with tests performed where appropriate (power, controller, sensor/display). We were unable to fully complete our prototype due to Julie being out of the office this week, so our final BOM hasn't been sent. Due to that we made progress where we could by completing our team poster and submitting our requests for our 3D print. We were denied our original request to the IMaker space due to the dimensions being too large. Ashli then went to the engineers in Brown to see if they could print it and they offered us the option to cut the current design into smaller sections or use stainless steel and cut it with the waterjet. This puts us in a tight window to finish our final model as soon as possible since our presentation date is slowly approaching. Because of this, however, until our parts are delivered, we are focusing our full attention on our final presentation that will be delivered May 1.
