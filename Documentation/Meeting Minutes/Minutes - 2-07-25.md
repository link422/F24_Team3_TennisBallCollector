## Meeting Notes: 

We began today’s meeting reviewing our BOM as it is due on Monday. We went through everyone’s individual BOM and combined it into one, so it will be ready to send off. We then went through each member’s progress with their tasks from last week as well as any additional work they have done in regard to the project. Following this, we decided to get a head start on the final presentation. This head start included us creating the presentation and discussing how we should pace work on it over the semester, so it doesn't sneak up on us at the very end.
