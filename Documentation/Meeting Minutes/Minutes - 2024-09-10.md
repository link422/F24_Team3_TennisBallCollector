Team 3 Meeting 2 Minutes 

Meeting began: 5:00 PM 

We began the meeting by calling the Tennessee Tech Golden Eagle Golf Club to set up a follow-up meeting. 
We were given the contact info of their coordinator, Matt, who we reached out via email.
In this email we informed him of our capstone project and tried to set up an in-person meeting for further discussion. 
Additionally, we sent a similar email to the TN Tech Men’s tennis coach to give us another option. 
The reasoning behind this is to provide us with two different sets of specifications to choose from, where the more 
realistic of the two will be chosen. We then narrowed down our choices for who we believe would be a good fit to serve as our advisor. 
These two options are Dr. Syed Ali Rizvi and Dr. Canfield. As a group we went to these professors' offices to talk to them about our 
project. Neither was in their office then, so we had to reach out later. Everybody was in attendence.


Meeting ended: 6:30 PM
