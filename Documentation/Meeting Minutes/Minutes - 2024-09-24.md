We began todayâ€™s meeting by reviewing what we last left off on, which was the proposal draft. We have now received our feedback, so we spent the meeting reviewing what changes we could possibly make. We also discussed what changes we need to make with our overall project goal after our discussion with our advisor, Dr. Canfield. After much brainstorming we decided to plan for a design similar to the previous model, but with a compact design, a sensor, and less susceptible to jamming. We have also set up an additional meeting with our customer to obtain further specifications to add to our proposal.
