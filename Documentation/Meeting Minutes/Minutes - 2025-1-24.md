## Meeting Notes: 

Today's meeting began with discussions of the construction of our functional prototype. Following this we discussed when our meeting times will be for this semester, which will be Tuesdays at 4:00 and Fridays at 12:00. We then discussed what is missing from each of the remaining detailed designs. For Maxwell, he has updated his detailed design but needs an additional meeting with the customer to get accurate measurements for the drawing of his design. For Gabriel, he just has to update his design based off his current feedback. Ashli also needs to meet with the customer for measurements along with an advisor meeting to gain input on how to mechanically attach the motors to the collector. An email was sent to the customer to schedule a meetup for Ashli and Maxwell.
