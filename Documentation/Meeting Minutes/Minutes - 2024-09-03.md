# Team 3 Meeting 1 Minutes  

	Meeting began: 5:03 PM 

## Meeting Notes
The meeting began with the team collaborating to create our teamwork contract. Every member participated in the creation of said contract. While making the contract, we assigned individual roles that we felt would be the most beneficial for the overall success of our project. The roles are as follows: 

Reporter: Maxwell Wynne 

Evaluator: Carter Brady 

Resource Investigator: Ashli Watkins 

Fine Tuner: Cindy Escobar 

Arbitrator: Tate Finley 

Project Coordinator: Gabriel Dubose 

After coming up with a rough draft of our contract we read through it as a team to make any changes that we saw as necessary. 

We also discussed how our future minutes will be written. Every week each member will provide information on their portion of the project. This includes progress made and any conflicts that arose. 

Everybody was in attendance at this meeting. 

	Meeting ended: 6:23 PM
