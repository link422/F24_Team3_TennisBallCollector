## Meeting Notes 

The meeting began with a check on everybody’s completion of this week’s CATME survey. Following that, we went back to our current draft of the conceptual design to review what we have and continue finishing it. For review we went back and read what we had at this given moment looking for grammar issues or anything that needed fixing. After reading the design we then assigned positions to the three different subsystems that we have for our project. Finally, we added our advisor into our GitHub repository so he along with our professor can review our proposal and design.
