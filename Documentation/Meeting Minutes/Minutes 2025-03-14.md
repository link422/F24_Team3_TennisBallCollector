Gabriel: contacted professor with diagram and  

Maxwell: Sent code to be tested on Pi 

Tate: Sent code to be tested on Pi 

 

## Meeting Notes: 

We began the meeting by connecting our raspberry pi to our power supply to verify that it can operate off of that instead of being plugged into a wall. This was successful, so we then updated each other on our subsystems. Ashli had an important update as she became aware that the size of the motor prohibits it from fitting in the intended location. Due to this, she plans on having the motors housed on top of the device, which will allow easier installation and functionality to her subsystem.  

 

## Tasks for Next Week: 

Ashli: configure motor controller to raspberry pi 

Carter: Continue configuring ROS 2 on raspberry pi 

Cindy: figure out how to configure vibration to raspberry pi 

Gabriel: establish circuit diagram for proper connections and order more cable connectors 

Maxwell: Edit code where necessary 

Tate: Edit code where necessary
