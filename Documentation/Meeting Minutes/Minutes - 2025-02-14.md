# Meeting Minutes 16 

    Meeting began: 12:00 PM 2/14/25 

Members in attendance: Ashli, Carter, Cindy, Gabriel, Maxwell, Tate 

 

## Tasks Completed: 

Ashli: conceptualized final design 

Carter: researched controller programming 

Cindy: updated design with change in relay 

Gabriel: got BOM finalized and ordered 

Maxwell: looked into specific coding for lidar sensors 

Tate: merged detailed design and looked into proper python libraries for project 

 

## Meeting Notes: 

We began the meeting by discussing the true implementation of each subsystem on the device. Ashli drew a model that shows the location of each subsystem in relation to the device. We then discussed what language we were planning on using for the subsystems requiring code. As of now we agreed upon using python for the sensor, display, and controller for consistency. It was also agreed upon by the team and suggested by our professor that we need to go ahead and just make our final model instead of working on a demo and model. This works out better for the team as we can now focus all our attention on the final product instead of finding/buying additional resources to make a smaller scale collector. After discussing this we moved on to working on our read.me file on GitHub.  

 

## Tasks for next Week: 

Ashli: meet with advisor  

Carter: continues working on/finish read.me file 

Cindy: meet with advisor 

Gabriel: begin LTSpice simulation 

Maxwell: meet with advisor 

Tate: install proper python libraries and begin display coding 

 

    Meeting ended: 12:44 PM 2/14/25
