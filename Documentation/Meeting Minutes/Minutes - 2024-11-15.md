    Meeting began: 12:00 PM 11/15/24 

Members in attendance: Ashli, Carter, Cindy, Gabriel, Maxwell, Tate 


## Tasks Completed: 

Ashli: Researched Motor subsystem (The operation of DC Motors) 

Carter: Researched RC subsystem (Budget and how controller connects to other components) 

Cindy: Researched Vibration subsystem (Application of vibration device on machine) 

Gabriel: Researched Power subsystem (Looked into how to distribute voltage and current) 

Maxwell: Researched Counting sensor subsystem (How to connect and operate sensor to Raspberry Pi) 

Tate: Researched Counting display subsystem (Reviewed datasheet for LCD display) 

 
## Meeting Notes: 

For todayâ€™s meeting we elected to not meet on Tuesday as regularly scheduled and instead met today on Friday. This decision was made to allow team members to have additional time to look into their respective subsystem. The meeting began with members discussing what they have discovered so far. These findings can be found above in the Tasks Completed section.  

 

## Tasks for next Week: 

Ashli: Continue research on Motor subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting, begin detailed design 

Carter: Continue research on RC subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting, begin detailed design 

Cindy: Continue research on Vibration subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting, begin detailed design 

Gabriel: Continue research on Power subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting, begin detailed design
