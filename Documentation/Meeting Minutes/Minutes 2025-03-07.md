# Meeting Minutes 19 

    Meeting began: 12:00 PM 3/7/25 

Members in attendance: Carter, Cindy, Maxwell, Tate 

Ashli and Gabriel were not able to attend today as they are attending a conference in Chicago for NSBE. 

 

## Tasks Completed: 

Ashli: Measure current of motors (doing it on Sunday when back from conference) 

Carter: Researched how to run all subsystems simultaneously 

Cindy: Began working with Carter to implement vibration with controller 

Gabriel: send circuit simulation to professor  

Maxwell: Finished first draft of code 

Tate: Finished first draft of code 

 

## Meeting Notes: 

We began todayâ€™s meeting by discussing our updates so far and what we need to do to have our prototype ready. Carter has been working with the Pi and came to the decision that he is going to run Ubuntu on the Pi so we can use ROS 2, which will allow all the different subsystems to run at one time seamlessly. Maxwell and Tate are both ready to test their code on the Pi to see what changes will need to be made, if any. Tate then sent his code to Carter and Maxwell so they can view it and see how they will be able to implement it on the Pi as well as with the sensor subsystem. 

 

## Tasks for Next Week: 

Ashli: Not in attendance (assume same) 

Carter: install Ubuntu and ROS 2 

Cindy: continue working on vibration and installation of device 

Gabriel: Not in attendance (assume same) 

Maxwell: Test code on Pi once Ubuntu is installed 

Tate: Test code on Pi once Ubuntu is installed 

 

    Meeting Ended: 12:55 PM 3/7/2025
