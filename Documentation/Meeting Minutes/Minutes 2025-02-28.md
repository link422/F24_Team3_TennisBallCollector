    Meeting began: 12:00 PM 2/28 /25 

Members in attendance: Ashli, Carter, Cindy, Gabriel, Maxwell, Tate 

 

## Tasks Completed: 

Ashli: contacted advisor  

Carter: controller configuration  

Cindy: contacted advisor 

Gabriel: discussed simulation concept with professor 

Maxwell: contacted advisor, progressed with sensor code 

Tate: display coding progressed 

 

## Meeting Notes: 

We began today’s meeting by taking our kit to the library since our monitor in the lab doesn’t have HDMI capability for the pi. Once in the library we began working on the pi by configuring it with our wireless controller. We were able to get it working, with the inputs of the controller being displayed in the terminal window on the pi. We then worked on our abstract so it will be ready to be turned in on Monday as well as our minimal functional prototype demo. After this we went to the tennis courts to collect the machine and transport it to the capstone lab. 

 

## Tasks for next Week: 

Ashli: Measure current of motors 

Carter: continue configuration as well as working with Cindy for vibration 

Cindy: work with Carter to implement vibration with controller 

Gabriel: send circuit simulation to professor 

Maxwell: Work with Tate on implementing sensor coding with display 

Tate: Work with Maxwell on implementing display coding with sensor
