# Meeting Minutes 10 

    Meeting began: 5:00 PM 11/5/24 

Members in attendance: Ashli, Carter, Cindy, Gabriel, Maxwell, Tate 

 

## Tasks Completed: 

Ashli: Researched Motor subsystem 

Carter: Researched RC subsystem 

Cindy: Researched Vibration subsystem 

Gabriel: Researched Power subsystem 

Maxwell: Researched Counting sensor subsystem 

Tate: Researched Counting display subsystem 

 

## Meeting Notes: 

For todayâ€™s meeting we decided to first dedicate our time to going over our conceptual as we await our approval to check for any last-minute changes we need to make. While doing this we discussed our plan to move forward with each of our subsystems. Our meetings will now be focused on sharing the individual research we do with our subsystems, so peer feedback can be provided, and any overlap will be known. Following this we took time to complete the different training that we must do in order to gain access to the Capstone lab. 

 

## Tasks for next Week: 

Ashli: Continue research on Motor subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting 

Carter: Continue research on RC subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting 

Cindy: Continue research on Vibration subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting 

Gabriel: Continue research on Power subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting 

Maxwell: Continue research on Counting sensor subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting 

Tate: Continue research on Counting display subsystem and prepare to report findings in next meeting 

    Meeting Ended: 6:35 PM 11/5/24
