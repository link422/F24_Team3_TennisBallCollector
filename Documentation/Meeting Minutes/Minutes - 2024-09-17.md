## Meeting Notes
The meeting first began with a discussion on where to move from our current point. It was quickly decided that an additional meeting with our advisor and customer is necessary. These follow-up meetings will help us put critiques on our proposal since the due date for that is nearing. Due to our busy schedules, it was decided that a meeting would be best suited to take place next week. Emails were sent to both parties and the meetings will take place at an agreed time. We also confirmed that everybody has completed the team critique on CATME. Lastly, we went through the course schedule to make sure we were up to date as a team, and get an idea of what is expected from us in the future 

## Tasks for next week:
