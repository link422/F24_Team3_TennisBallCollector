## Meeting Notes
The meeting began with us looking over the template for the conceptual design before we began implementing the design itself. Unfortunately for us, our project proposal is still waiting for our final approval, so with that in mind we are doing what we can at this given moment knowing something is liable to change. Because of this, the group chose to meet again on Friday, hopefully with a finalized proposal, to continue working on the conceptual design. It also needs to be noted that our customer has still yet to reach back out to us with a time when we can view the device, so an additional email was sent.
