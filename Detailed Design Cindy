#Detailed Design

## Function of the Subsystem

The Vibration System is designed to address tennis ball jamming within the roller mechanism of the Playmate Tennis Ball Mower 1.0 [1]. 
By utilizing dual DC vibration motors, this subsystem provides a targeted solution that induces vibrations to dislodge jammed tennis balls, 
ensuring uninterrupted collection and system efficiency. The motors are strategically positioned on either side of the collector and are 
activated via button switches protected by membrane overlays to safeguard against environmental exposure.

## Specifications and Constraints

The system shall use Vybronics DC Vibration Motors (VZ4KC1B1051202)[2].
Rationale: This motor is compact, lightweight, and capable of producing sufficient vibration force (1.3 G) to dislodge jammed tennis balls, 
aligning with the subsystem's requirements for performance and integration.

The vibration motors shall operate at 3.0 V DC with a current draw of approximately 60 mA per motor.
Rationale: Operating at the motor’s rated specifications ensures reliable performance and prevents premature wear or failure due to overvoltage 
or excessive current.

The subsystem shall be powered directly by the Lithium Polymer Battery [3] integrated into the power supply system.
Rationale: Using the shared power source simplifies system design, reduces the need for additional power components, and minimizes weight and 
space requirements.

The vibration motors shall be activated by button switches [4] mounted within the collector, covered with membrane overlays.
Rationale: The button switches ensure that the vibration motors are only activated when needed, while the membrane overlays provide 
environmental protection from dust, debris, and moisture.

The system shall comply with relevant safety standards to protect users and maintain operational safety.
Rationale: Adhering to safety standards minimizes the risk of injury or malfunction, ensuring the system can be safely operated and maintained.

The subsystem shall be protected from environmental factors, including dust and moisture, to ensure long-term durability and functionality.
Rationale: Environmental protection safeguards critical components, reducing maintenance requirements and extending the system's operational lifespan.


## Overview of Proposed Solution

The proposed solution for the vibration system utilizes two compact Vybronics DC vibration motors (VZ4KC1B1051202) mounted on opposite sides of 
the tennis ball collector to effectively dislodge jammed balls. Powered by the system's 3.7 V Lithium Polymer Battery, the motors operate at 3.0 V DC 
with a current draw of 60 mA, regulated by a voltage step-down mechanism to ensure optimal performance and longevity. Activation is controlled by 
strategically placed button switches, shielded by durable membrane overlays to protect against dust and moisture. The system is designed to comply with 
safety standards, maintaining effective vibration levels without compromising stability or user safety, while a sealed housing safeguards components 
from environmental factors. This energy-efficient, cost-effective solution integrates seamlessly with the power supply and other subsystems, providing a 
reliable mechanism to enhance the functionality and efficiency of the Playmate Tennis Ball Mower.


## Interface with Other Subsystems

The vibration system interfaces with other subsystems, particularly the power supply and sensor subsystems, ensuring compatibility and non-disruptive 
operation. The system is powered by its dedicated Lithium Polymer Battery, which provides the required 3.0 V DC for the vibration motors via a voltage 
regulator, ensuring reliable performance while maintaining operational independence from other subsystems. It also integrates with the sensor subsystem, 
with careful calibration of the vibration motors to avoid interference with ball counting or detection processes, preserving sensor accuracy. The button 
switches used to activate the motors are designed for seamless integration, ensuring reliable functionality without affecting other subsystems such as the 
RC controller or motor systems. This dedicated and non-intrusive design ensures efficient operation while maintaining subsystem compatibility and overall 
system stability.

## Analysis

The proposed design for the vibration system is robust, cost-effective, and meets all specified constraints. The use of two independent 
vibration motors (Vybronics VZ4KC1B1051202) ensures that jamming can be addressed on either side of the collector. The motors' low current draw of 
60 mA and vibration force of 1.3 G are optimal for dislodging jammed tennis balls without causing structural damage.
The dual Lithium Polymer Batteries (EEMB 2000mAh) provide ample power for continuous operation while maintaining lightweight portability. 
The addition of voltage regulators (LM317) ensures the motors receive a consistent 3.0 V output, preventing overvoltage damage. The momentary pushbutton 
switches allow manual activation, simplifying the design and removing the need for additional sensors. The protective membrane overlays enhance durability 
by safeguarding buttons from dust and moisture.
This system aligns with safety standards, is straightforward to assemble, and minimizes power consumption. Testing and calibration will ensure compliance 
with operational stability requirements.
